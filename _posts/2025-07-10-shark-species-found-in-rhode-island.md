# Shark Species Found in Rhode Island!
  *This is a short fun post about 2 different types of sharks found in Rhode Island!*
  
## What Are Sharks?
  Sharks are marine animals classified as Elasmobranchs, characterized for having cartilaginous skeletons instead of bone. Skates and rays also fall under the Elasmobranch subclass.

### 1. _Mustelus canis_ - Smooth Dogfish
- Smooth dogfish have many small rounded teeth, perfect for crushing through hard shells. 
- They are viviparous meaning they give birth to live young.
